# BCI-bot
This bot's intention is to scrape the blog [Bad Conlanging Ideas](http://badconlangingideas.tumblr.com/) and allow users to interact with it.

## What is Bad Conlanging Ideas?
A conlang, short for constructed language, is a creative work at making a language. It can be for artistic purposes, like JRR Tolkien's Elvish languages, or to attempt to act as a neutral second language, like Esperanto, or to test a philosopical or linguistic quirk, like Toki Pona.

Many of the features of this new medium allow for humor about how to do it in a very bizarre way. Additionally, many people who conlang, from linguistic naïvité or whatnot, do things that are very counter to their goals, like misread linguistic terminology. The blog pokes fun at both kinds of bad conlanging, in the form of suggestions (hence, the ideas).

## What does this bot do?
The bot is for the chat service Discord, where it allows users to:
* Ask the bot for all bad conlanging ideas a specified user made.
* Look at a paticular bad conlanging idea, given its number.
* Ask for a random idea, weighted by popularity of posts.
